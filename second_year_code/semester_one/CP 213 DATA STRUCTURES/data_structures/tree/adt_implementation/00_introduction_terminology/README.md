# ADT: Introduction and Terminology

- **Tree**: Non-linear structure made of connected nodes.
- **Root**: Top-most node.
- **Parent/Child**: Connected relationship.
- **Leaf**: Node with no children.
- **Subtree**: Tree rooted at any node.
- **Height**: Longest path from root to a leaf (in edges).

In ADT style, users call methods like `insert()` or `search()` while internal pointers stay hidden in the class.
