                                FINAL GROUP ASSIGNMENT


Discuss all questions. Prepare a hardcopy document for marking and a folder of programs for
presentation.
Question One
  a. Using C++ write a code segment to implement a linked list of five nodes using integer
     data type.
  b. Show how the three first nodes of your linked list were linked.
Question Two
  a. Using C++ write a code to build a queue of five nodes of characters.
  b. Show how the two three nodes of your queue are built and linked.
Question Three
  a. Using C++ write a code segment to implement a stack of five nodes of strings.
  b. Using RAM diagrams show how data is and popping are carried out.
Question Four
  a. Using C++ write a code to implement a binary tree of integers for at least one level of
     branching of characters.
  b. Show how the first left-side node is created and how it gets its data.
Question Five
  a. Using C++ Write a code to traverse the tree in an post-order pattern.
  b. Using RAM diagrams show how the traversal is accomplished.
Question Six
  a. Given an array of integers of size six. write a code segment to implement a bubble sort
     algorithm on it.
  b. RAM diagrams show how data is exchanged between variables.
Question Seven
  a. Write a code segment to implement a Quick Sort algorithm on an array size of 6.
  b. Using RAM diagrams how the first partition is performed.
Question Eight
  a. Write a code segment to implement a Q-Sort algorithm on an array size of 6.
  b. Using RAM diagrams how the first merge is performed.
