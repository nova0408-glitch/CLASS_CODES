# CP 215 Java Assignments

This root folder contains different practicals for **CP 215 Object Oriented Programming in Java**.

## Directory Overview

- `practical_2/` - Practical 2 solutions (already existing).
- `practical_3/` - Practical 3 solutions (already existing).
- `practical_4/` - New folder with Practical 4 PDF and solutions `QuestionOne` to `QuestionEleven`.
- `practical_5/` - New folder with Practical 5 PDF and solutions `QuestionOne` to `QuestionFive`.
- `practical_6/` - Practical 6 solutions (already existing).
- `practical_7/` - Practical 7 solutions (already existing).
- `practical_8/` - Lab 8 PDF and solutions `QuestionOne` to `QuestionSeven`.

## How Question Folders Work

Each practical folder uses this pattern:

- One folder per question: `QuestionOne`, `QuestionTwo`, ...
- Each question folder contains Java file(s) for that question.
- Some questions have two Java files when the lab requires multiple classes.

## Compile and Run (General)

1. Open a question folder, for example:

```bash
cd practical_8/QuestionOne
```

2. Compile:

```bash
javac *.java
```

3. Run the main class (usually matches the question name):

```bash
java QuestionOne
```

## Notes

- Solutions are written in a beginner-friendly style.
- Inline comments are included throughout the code to explain key steps.
- Existing older practical files were left unchanged.
